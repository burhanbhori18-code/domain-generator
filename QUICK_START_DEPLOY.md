## ✅ What I've Already Done For You

I've created all the files needed for deployment:
- ✅ `render.yaml` - Render configuration
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Tells Git which files to ignore

- ✅ Deployment guides

**Your code is ready to deploy!**

### **Option B: Follow The Guide Yourself**

## ❓ Questions?

- Your team just visits the URL in their browser

**"What if I don't have a GitHub account?"**
- No problem! I'll guide you to create one (2 minutes)

**"Is it really free?"**
- Yes! Render's free tier includes:
  - 750 hours/month (enough for 24/7)
  - 512MB RAM
  - Sleeps after 15 min of inactivity (wakes up automatically)
